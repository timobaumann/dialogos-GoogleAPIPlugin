# DialogOS Client to access Google ASR, translation, and a few other things

The client can be executed via `./gradlew run`. Once started, you can run the example DialogOS dialog model to check ASR and translation work as expected.

For ASR to work, you'll need a Google API key and set it as Java property google-api-key or as environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY.
